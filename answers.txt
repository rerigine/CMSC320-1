Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Managing our code and large data spaces when it comes to data manipulation.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Fantasy Sports Predictors is a field where is Data Science is applied. For example, Fantasy Football users will draft NFL players based on their supposed potential for the upcoming season. Data Science via relevant data scientists and machines like IBM watson are able to utilize statistical analysis to provide predicted points for players. At first glance, this analysis would not be seen and can certainly higher the chances of a successful fantasy football team.

Q3: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to develop a versatile coding skillset that will allow me to manipulate big data in a way where certain processes can be applied to different instances, whether it is sports statistics or educational records.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to gain the skill of understanding what big datasets can be understood as and how they can be managed to make proper assumptions. I currently am more used to simply solving problems put in front of me, technically. But the inclusion of data science can add on accuracy and holistic implementation of trends I may see in data.
